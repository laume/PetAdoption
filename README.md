# PetAdoption

In these notebooks I am predicting the speed at which a pet is adopted, based on the pet’s listing on PetFinder. Sometimes a profile represents a group of pets. In this case, the speed of adoption is determined by the speed at which all of the pets are adopted. The data included text, tabular, and image data. See below for details. 
This is a Kernels-only competition. At the end of the competition, test data will be replaced in their entirety with new data of approximately the same size, and your kernels will be rerun on the new data.

### File descriptions

`train.csv` - Tabular/text data for the training set

`test.csv` - Tabular/text data for the test set

`sample_submission.csv` - A sample submission file in the correct format

`breed_labels.csv` - Contains Type, and BreedName for each BreedID. Type 1 is dog, 2 is cat.

`color_labels.csv` - Contains ColorName for each ColorID

`state_labels.csv` - Contains StateName for each StateID

RescuerID - Unique hash ID of rescuer

VideoAmt - Total uploaded videos for this pet

PhotoAmt - Total uploaded photos for this pet

Description - Profile write-up for this pet. The primary language used is English, with some in Malay or Chinese.


### AdoptionSpeed

Contestants are required to predict this value. The value is determined by how quickly, if at all, a pet is adopted. The values are determined in the following way: 

0 - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed. 

1 - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed. 

2 - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed. 

3 - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed.

4 - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days).


### Images

For pets that have photos, they will be named in the format of PetID-ImageNumber.jpg. Image 1 is the profile (default) photo set for the pet. For privacy purposes, faces, phone numbers and emails have been masked.

### Image Metadata

We have run the images through Google's Vision API, providing analysis on Face Annotation, Label Annotation, Text Annotation and Image Properties. You may optionally utilize this supplementary information for your image analysis.

File name format is PetID-ImageNumber.json.

Some properties will not exist in JSON file if not present, i.e. Face Annotation. Text Annotation has been simplified to just 1 entry of the entire text description (instead of the detailed JSON result broken down by individual characters and words). Phone numbers and emails are already anonymized in Text Annotation.

### Sentiment Data

We have run each pet profile's description through Google's Natural Language API, providing analysis on sentiment and key entities. You may optionally utilize this supplementary information for your pet description analysis. There are some descriptions that the API could not analyze. As such, there are fewer sentiment files than there are rows in the dataset.

File name format is PetID.json.
